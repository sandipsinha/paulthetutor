PUTTING PROGRAMS ONTO YOUR CALCULATOR
To put programs on calculator you must link download the programs to your computer and then link your calculator to the computer.  The following software http://education.ti.com/educationportal/sites/US/productDetail/us_ti_connect.html will allow you to link to your computer and load programs onto the calculator.

If you have a ti83, you will probably have to buy this connection kit http://education.ti.com/educationportal/sites/US/productDetail/us_ti_connectivity_kit.html since it may not have a usb connection.
 

PROGRAMS
Don't try to run any programs that start with a 'y' or 'z'.  They are only there to help other programs run.  You need them or the other programs will not work, but you do not run them directly.
