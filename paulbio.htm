<span class="Head2_Green">History</span><br>
Paul began tutoring in 1990, when he was hired as a counselor and calculus tutor for the 
STEP program at the University of California at Santa Barbara.  Drawn to students whose needs did 
not seem to be met by traditional educators, Paul began to focus his efforts on supporting students 
with learning disabilities and focusing trouble, accelerated and advanced placement students, and 
students who, quite simply, were difficult to teach.  After a decade of firsthand research and 
experience, Paul became fascinated with the connection between academic learning and cognitive 
abilities.  His findings, compiled while attending the Harvard Graduate School of Education, 
became the basis for the <a href="http://www.paulthetutors.com/lls_concept.php">Logical Learning 
System</a>&trade;.

<span class="Head2_Green">The Logical Learning System&trade;</span><br>
Developed over several years and compiled by Paul while attending 
the Harvard Graduate School of Education, The <a href="http://www.paulthetutors.com/lls_concept.php">
Logical Learning System</a>&trade; has its foundations in the recognition that academics are most 
valuable as a tool for helping students to develop practically useful cognitive abilities, 
including problem solving, understanding, memory, and communication.  When students learn to 
harness these cognitive abilities, they can improve their comprehension of class material and 
apply this knowledge to their professional and social lives.

<span class="Head2_Green">Math as a Second Language</span><br>
Paul is also the creator of MSL math, a system that helps students to 
better process and relate to mathematical expressions.  Too often, students think of math as 
telling them to do something, whether it is add, subtract, or find the square root of a number.  
When students learn to see math as descriptive, pointing out relationships between quantities and 
expressions, then they finally understand the problem, as well as the rationale behind the 
solution.
