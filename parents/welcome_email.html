<h3>Username and Password</h3>
<p>If you registered online, then you should have chosen your own username and password.  If you registered by phone, or by paper, then you have been assigned a temporary username and password. You can have your username and password sent to you by going to <a href="http://www.paulthetutors.com/parents/getlostinfo.php">www.paulthetutors.com/parents/getlostinfo.php</a> and entering your email address.

<h3>Scheduling</h3>
<p>Once you have met with your tutor, you should do all future scheduling through them. Every tutor is given their own phone line and paulthetutors.com email address for contact with parents and students. They should provide you with this and other contact information at your first meeting, and you can always visit <a href="http://www.paulthetutors.com/parents/tutors.php">www.paulthetutors.com/parents/tutors.php</a> to find contact information for all of our tutors.  If you have not been assigned a tutor please call our main line (510) 730-0390 or email us at <a href="mailto:info@paulthetutors.com">info@paulthetutors.com</a> so that we can pick the best tutor for your needs.
</p>
<h3>E-Billing</h3><p>
We do not take payment at the end of each session, and tutors may not accept payment directly. Instead, at the end of each month, we will send you an e-bill, to the billing email address you provided. You should receive the bill some time around the 5th of each month.  Be sure to put <a href="mailto:billing@paulthetutors.com">billing@paulthetutors.com</a> in your friends list, so the email does not go to your spam inbox.  You can also see your bill, as well as other accounting information, at any time, by logging in to <a href="http://www.paulthetutors.com/parents/">www.paulthetutors.com/parents</a>.
