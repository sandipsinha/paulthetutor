      If this is your first interview, please show up 5 minutes early to fill out paperwork and bring contact information for 3 references.  <br><br>

<B>If you are applying for a tutoring position</B> two of you references will be parents of students you have tutored, or the students themselves, if they are over 18.  Understand that you will be asked to perform mock tutorials in the subjects which you hope to tutor.  Be sure to refresh your memory as the topics you will be asked to tutor will be somewhat challenging.<br><br>
