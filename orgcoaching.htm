Paul the Tutor's provides Organizational Coaching for students who struggle to meet deadlines and submit coursework.  Students with ambitious extracurricular schedules also choose organizational coaching because it helps them to balance their school life with their extracurricular and social lives.
<p>
Our organizational coaches design programs for each student based on their unique schedules and set of challenges.  Sessions help students to cultivate time management and study skills, and to create a sense of balance before entering college.
