<hr size="1" color="black">

At Paul the Tutor's Education Center, we are committed to helping students develop core cognitive
 skills such as problem solving and critical reasoning. Our approach is based on Paul's 
 <a href="lls_concept.php">Logical Learning System</a>&trade;, a method that uses academics as a 
 launching pad to teach students how to read, write, and reason better. We believe that better 
 thinking leads to better grades and better test scores, and that the skills we teach will help 
 students succeed in academics and beyond.
