<p>

For the growing number of students with learning disabilities who take the SAT and ACT tests each year, the preparation process is especially rigorous.  As an expert in the fields of Learning and Cognition as well as a dyslexic test taker himself, Paul understands the unique challenges LD students face when it comes to test preparation. In his talk, Paul will discuss:
<ul>
<li>How learning disabilities affect students' performance on the SAT and ACT exams</li>
<li>Whether students should sign up for the SAT or ACT test</li>
<li>If extended time is the right option for your student, and how it affects the admissions process</li>
<li>A timeline for preparing and taking college entrance exams for LD students</li>
</ul>
 
<p>
Paul the Tutor, Ed.M., has educated students with learning disabilities for over twenty years.  He studied Cognition at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and is the author of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Study-Guide-Ed-M-Paul-Osborne/dp/159257887X/ref=tag_stp_st_edpp_url" target="_book">LD SAT Study Guide</a>, the first and only SAT preparation manual for students who learn differently.  No one knows more about learning disabilities and standardized testing than Paul the Tutor, and he looks forward to sharing his knowledge and insights with you.
