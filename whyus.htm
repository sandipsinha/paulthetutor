<span class="Head2">The Success You Can Expect</span><br>
		1) Grades improving.<br>
    2) Math and science making sense.<br>
    3) Students gain an ability to understand concepts without aid.<br>
    <br>


<span class="Head2">Why We're Successful</span><br>
<strong>1) <a href="lls_concept.php">Logical Learning System</a> - Teaching Students to Think Better</strong><br>
					 Since we focus on developing students skills as opposed to repeated contact between the student and their academic subject, my students are simply better prepared to succeed with every session.<p>
<strong>2) Math as a Second Language</strong><br>
					 Math is not only a quantitative value science.  First, it is a language designed to describe quantities and quantitative ideas. <p>
<strong>3) Camaraderie</strong><br>
					 At Paul the Tutor's, it is the tutor and the student conquering math together, not the student versus the tutor and the math. <p>

					 
<span class="Head2">What Paul the Tutor Brings</span><br>
1) 20 years of tutoring experience.<br>
2) Masters Degree in Education, Harvard Graduate School of Education.<br>
3) Dedicated expertise in tutoring students who need something extra.<br>
