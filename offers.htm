We are so certain you will benefit from your class at Paul the Tutor's that we encourage new students to try any class for free. If you like it enough to schedule more classes, we will include it in your bill. Otherwise, your Paul the Tutor's class is on us.<p>
<span class="Head2_Green">Private Tutoring</span><br>
While all of our tutors are trained experts in their fields, we understand the importance of finding the right "match" for our students.  If for any reason you are not fully satisfied with your session, we will schedule you with a different tutor, free of charge.
